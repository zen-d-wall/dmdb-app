# IT DOESN'T SUPPORT MOBILE YET! (W.I.P)

# The App

If you wanna visit the current state of the website in production, please refer to this link: https://dmdb-app.vercel.app/


## The Purpose

Denzel Movies Database (or simply DMDB) is a web application that serves those who love movies, enabling them to look for what is trending based on the Genre, or even look for the current list of Best Movies in the history in the simplest way possible.

## How it works?

In order to offer all the content in an organized and well performing way, I make use of Routes and Context API to build the app and deploy it on Vercel.

## Source

All the data and content seeing in the DMDB app comes from The Movie Databse (TMDB) API.
